# FAT-8

Simple CHIP-8 interpreter written in C using ncurses for graphics and keyboard handling.

## Installation and running

To compile the program run ``make``

Usage: ``bin/fat-8 ROM_PATH [SPEED_MULTIPLIER]``

CHIP-8 delay and sound timers run at 60 Hz, default execution speed of FAT-8 is also 60 Hz, to make it run faster pass an
optional command line argument SPEED_MULTIPLIER.

## TODO

- add SDL/OpenGL mode with sound
- smooth out handling of keypad by ncurses (if possible ((not really)))
