## Sources

CHIP-8 specification based on:

[CHIP‚Äê8 Technical Reference (Matthew Mikolay)](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/CHIP%E2%80%908-Technical-Reference)

[Timendus' Chip Test Suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)

Following resources were used at the beggining of this project but were found to by largely innacurate and were therefore abandoned:

## TODO

- fix bugs (space invaders)
- add SDL/OpenGL mode with sound
- smooth out handling of keypad by ncurses (if possible)
